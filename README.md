# CFB–HGO–DO Quadrotor Control (MATLAB)

Command-filtered backstepping (CFB) with a high-gain observer (HGO) and a disturbance observer (DO) for quadrotor trajectory tracking under wind and model mismatch.

## We have
- MATLAB/Simulink implementation of the controller and observers
- Example scripts to reproduce the main tracking results
- Small sample data for quick runs (add your own if needed)

## Requirements
- MATLAB
- Toolboxes: Control System Toolbox, Optimization Toolbox, Robotics System Toolbox

## Quick start
1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open MATLAB and set the repo folder as the working directory.
3. Add paths.
